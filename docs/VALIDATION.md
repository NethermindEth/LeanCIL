# Validation results

Validated on Windows with .NET SDK **10.0.402** and Lean **4.35.0** on 2026-10-14.

```sh
lake build
dotnet run --file scripts/Test.cs
```

The regression runner covers **42 check groups** across ten C# partitions. This includes initial CLI proof selection and theorem output, an actual addition-to-subtraction source edit and rebuild, recovery using settings retained after the failed proof, the invalid-memory-access theorem, and the integer opcode, narrow-storage and primitive-operation matrices. The CLI group also passed separately against an isolated installation of the packaged .NET tool before the integer opcode extension.

The runner builds the independent assemblies and the CIL library, then creates a fresh source-only Lean build for verification. File-based C# apps provide the test runner, verifier and metadata fixture generator. Their only external package is the same pinned Mono.Cecil version used by the extractor.

The runner accepts `--suite core`, `--suite cli`, `--suite integer`, `--suite narrow` `--suite primitive` `--suite division` `--suite checked` `--suite conversions` `--suite native` and `--suite arguments` after `--`. These partitions cover the same 42 check groups as the full command and can run concurrently in separate checkouts. Each partition builds its own prerequisites, retains fresh Lean proof checking and writes `artifacts/test-results-<suite>.json`; running without arguments checks everything and writes `artifacts/test-results.json`.

The addition theorem proves modular arithmetic correctness for arbitrary 64-bit inputs in the checked execution model. The unsigned-short theorem proves reduction modulo 65,536 for arbitrary 32-bit inputs. The invalid-access and expired-reference theorems classify faults and rule out successful execution for every fuel budget. The subtraction theorem independently refutes the intended addition result. Other example claims have the quantifiers and inputs displayed in their theorem statements; concrete examples do not establish universal method correctness.

All audited example theorems use only the permitted standard Lean axioms, if any. No new axioms, `sorry`, `admit`, native proof evaluation or unproved summaries were added. See [the trusted base](SOUNDNESS.md) for runtime and extraction assumptions.

Machine-readable results are written to `artifacts/test-results.json`; each successful proof produces an identity-bound `verified.json`. These generated files are reproducible outputs and are not committed. Consumer-project integration and broad .NET runtime coverage are outside these validation results.
